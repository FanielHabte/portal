       <h3>My backgroud</h3> 

       <p>  I was born and raised in Eritrea, a small country in East Africa. I am a middle child from a family of five. My upbringing was as a typical family. Even though they faced a lot of adversities, my parents did whatever they could to raise us. In 2017, after Graduating high school with a 3.2 GPA, I went to the Eritrean Institute of Technology (EIT) for six months. But By the end of 2018, I left my country and went to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in search of better opportunities and to reunite with the rest of my family living in the United States. After living there for over three years, I arrived in Seattle, where I have been since 2021.
    </p>
      
           
      <p> After coming to the USA, I worked as a Bookkeeper, which gave me great experience in gathering, analyzing, and managing data. Also, working in this role significantly impacted my professional development. Additionally, I am an Amazon delivery driver.   </p>

       <h3>Certification and skills</h3>

       <p> In the Appdev Track, from which I will graduate in 2024, I am developing my skills in HTML, CSS, JAVA, and PYTHON. Also, I have trained and earned a certificate for JAVA basics in 2021; Additionally, I am pursuing AWS and python Certifications. As a person, I am very self-driven and goal-oriented, which helped me map my future and achieve my goals until now.  </p>
